  summary: QIIME2 plugin for normalizing sequences by 16S rRNA gene copy number based on rrnDB database
  description: |
    This QIIME 2 plugin normalizes sequences by 16S rRNA gene copy number (GCN) 
    based on rrnDB database (version 5.7). The plugin matches the taxa of sequences 
    with the rrnDB-5.6_pantaxa_stats_NCBI.tsv file, starting from the lowest taxonomic rank. 
    If a match is found, the mean of GCN for the taxon is assigned; if not, the plugin 
    will try to match a higher rank until the highest rank is met. All the unassigned 
    sequences are assumed to have one GCN.
