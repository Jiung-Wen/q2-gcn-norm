All the unassigned\nsequences are assumed to have one GCN.\n", "home": "https://github.com/Jiung-Wen/q2-gcn-norm", "license": "BSD-3-Clause", "license_family": "BSD", "summary": "QIIME2 plugin for normalizing sequences by 16S rRNA gene copy number based on rrnDB database"}, "extra": {"copy_test_source_files": true, "final": true}}
